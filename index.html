                    I am really glad to be the one you are celebrating with on

                    heart. I still remember back when you became offline for a
                    lot of days, because you said you were too busy with your
                    birthday. I really thought it was over back then. To be
                    honest, I can still remember how surprised I was when I saw
                    your game profile lit up again. Later did I know that it
                    would be the start of our "not-so-expected" love story. I
                    have some unsaid words that I couldn't tell you directly and
                    I am hoping that I can express them here.

                    I cannot write words creatively so forgive me if I say
                    things directly, okay? Hmm, where do I begin... first off, I
                    want to say that I am really sorry for all the things that I
                    have done to make you cry. Whenever I say things about other
                    guys. Whenever we fight, I always say things to defend
                    myself, leading to you always blaming yourself. Whenever you
                    try to joke about something, I always overreact and say or
                    do something that would make you upset. But most
                    importantly, I felt like a real shitty person after making
                    you go into the phase that I promised myself to not ever
                    happen. I cannot promise you again, but this time, I would
                    like to give it all my best to change the attitude and other
                    things that upsets you. I must admit that I am a very
                    sensitive partner, and I am so happy and glad that you are
                    still choosing me everyday. Sometimes, I also love it when
                    we argue. It helps me to reflect and think of all the things
                    I have done. I hate fixing or making up or whatever whenever
                    I fight or argue with someone, be it my family or friends.
                    But you are the only person that I am willing to fix again
                    and again when things does not go well. I love you.

                    There are no words that can express my gratitude. Having
                    someone to support me, love me, motivate me, and... bash me,
                    all at the same time is the best. Having YOU, is the best.
                    Love, I also want to say that I would always be proud of
                    you, no matter what. If you are my supporter, then I am my
                    supporter's supporter, hehe. I am always here to support
                    each and every decision you will make. As long as it is for
                    good and I know that will help you grow as a person. I know
                    that your grades are reaally important for you. But I
                    reaaaallyy hope you don't pressure and stress yourself out
                    too much. As much as I love to see my girlfriend doing her
                    best, I don't want to see you become distress for being
                    dissatisfied of your grade, or for not achieving the rank
                    you want. They may not say it in front of you but I know
                    that your parents are proud of you too, love. Also, you are
                    very pretty. Just in case I have't told you. You are
                    reaaaaallly beautiful, like really. Lastly, I want to say
                    that I will always be by your side. I will always be happy
                    to do things for you. Spoil you with a lot of things. And
                    grow with you. That's all for this letter, my Love. I love
                    you always.
